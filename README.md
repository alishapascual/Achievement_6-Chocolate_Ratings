# Achievement_6-Chocolate_Ratings
Lists all my scripts, data, etc. for my Chocolate Ratings Analysis in Jupyter.
And a link to my storyboard about my Chocolate Ratings Analysis in Tableau.

I got my data from was [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/chocolate-bar-ratings) about a website that did ratings on dark chocolate bars called [Flavors of Cacao](http://flavorsofcacao.com/index.html).
